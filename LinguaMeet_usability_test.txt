User feedback:

Overall:
He really likes the idea, he said he would use it.

Suggestions and comments when using the prototype:
If app does not have FB login I will not use it.
Instead of a search bar for things to learn, have predefined opntions to avoid
confusions.
Confused when he wanted to see the profile. Have an icon always that allows easy
navigation to main screen and profile.
Gear icon is only for settings. 
Have a bottom bar or fixed top bar to easy navigate.
Add privacy to settings. Who can see your profile? Friend request?
Inbox can suggest meetup places.
Ability to send events or meetings so that the other person can accept. Calendar
sync?

To make money:
- Suggested places have to pay.
- Adds related to learning.
