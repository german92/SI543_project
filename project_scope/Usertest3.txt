User feedback:
  Overall: very intuitive, liked the idea, would use it.
  Specific comments: 
    -Would like a way to have "friends" and to see their recent activity
    -Likes having access to the inbox all of the time
    -Likes familiarity of settings and inbox buttons at top
    -Would like notifications of new messages if she doesn't have the app open
    -Let users know what apps/items the phone is using (in response to thinking that the "send message" button would go into email")
